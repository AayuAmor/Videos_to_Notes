# Videos to Notes App

**A Multimodal Productivity Web App using Gemini 2.5 Pro**

---

## Overview

Client Videos to Notes App is a web application that converts video content into structured notes, making learning, reviewing, and summarizing videos effortless.

This app demonstrates **multimodal AI capabilities** by processing both **video and audio content** to generate concise, meaningful notes.

---

## Features

- Extracts key points and summaries from videos
- Converts audio from videos into readable notes
- Supports multiple video formats
- Fully interactive and user-friendly interface

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **AI Integration:** Gemini 2.5 Pro API (via GitHub Pro, free tier)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (used free hosting due to limited access to paid cloud services)

---

## Deployment Note

> ⚠️ Note: The app is deployed on Vercel instead of Google Cloud Run because I did not use any paid cloud services. All AI functionality relies on the **free tier of Gemini 2.5 Pro**.
>
> ⚠️ **Important:** The Gemini API is used on the free tier, so some features may not work as efficiently or reliably as with the paid version.
